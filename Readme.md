# react-ssr

This is a small project that I made to understand react server side rendering.

If you're looking for high quality code, this is _not_ the place.

This is just a hacked together piece of code to understand React SSR concepts.

## Run

To run the project, run `npm run webpack` in one terminal pane and `npm run dev` in another.
